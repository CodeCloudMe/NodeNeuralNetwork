#Nodejs Neural Network
##Description
This is a nodejs implementation of dense neural network with two hidden layer and one category output layer.

It uses [compute cluster](https://github.com/lloyd/node-compute-cluster) for splitting the work into multiple cores and [numeric](http://www.numericjs.com/documentation.html) for linear algebra computations - basically verctorised implementation.
